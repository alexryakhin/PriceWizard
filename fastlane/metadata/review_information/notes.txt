Price Wizard is a Mac app for developers who manage App Store subscription pricing. It uses the official App Store Connect API.

AUTHENTICATION
Users sign in with their own App Store Connect API key (Key ID, Issuer ID, and .p8 file). The app stores these in the system Keychain only for signing API requests. We do not collect, transmit, or have access to user credentials.

NETWORK
The app connects only to:
1. https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com - official App Store Connect API (apps, subscription groups, subscriptions, price points, equalizations, territories, create subscription prices).
2. https://api.frankfurter.dev - public API for USD exchange rates (used for “New Price (USD)” in the preview table). There is a built-in fallback if the request fails.

No analytics, no third-party SDKs, no data sent to the developer. No account with us - only the user’s Apple ID and their App Store Connect API key.

TESTING
To test, the reviewer will need an App Store Connect API key with access to at least one app that has a subscription group. Create one at App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API. The app will prompt for Key ID, Issuer ID, and the .p8 file.
