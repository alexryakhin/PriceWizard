Price Wizard sets your App Store subscription prices for every territory from one screen - no more updating 175 countries by hand.

FOR DEVELOPERS WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS

• Connect with your App Store Connect API key (Key ID, Issuer ID, .p8 file). Your key stays in your Mac’s Keychain; we never see it.
• Pick a US base price and see a full preview: new price per territory, in local currency and USD.
• Choose Apple Equalization, Netflix-style, or Spotify-style regional pricing and tweak any territory.
• Apply all changes in one go. The app skips territories that already have the target price and won’t let you apply on a date that already has a scheduled change.

No account with us - just your Apple ID and your App Store Connect API key.

PRIVACY

We don’t collect or receive your data. Credentials are stored only in your Mac’s Keychain. The app talks only to Apple’s API and to a public exchange-rate service for USD conversion.

Requires: macOS 15 or later. An App Store Connect API key with App Manager (or Admin) access.
